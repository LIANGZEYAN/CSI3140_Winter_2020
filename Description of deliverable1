For this web application, we plan to  build an online shopping web page. <br/>
On this webpage, user  have to sign in with a new email and individual password. <br/>
After logging in, users can search the ideal item what they want(All items are <br/>
sorted and classificated by different catagray ) and save the item or put them <br/>
in shopping cart , they can also check out directly or remove the item from the <br/>
shopping cart(not pay)by themselves. Customers should provide a valid address and <br/>
phone number or the order cannot be completed. The webpage accepts credit and debit <br/>
card online paying.
